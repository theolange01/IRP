# <div align="center">IRP - Development of a Tracking System for the Surveillance of Birds in Airports</div>

With the recent development of air travel as a common mean of transport, the question of safety and security in airports has become crucial. Amongst all the different existing danger, birds are considered as one of the main threats to aircraft safety. Bird strikes occur mainly during landing and take off. However, the current surveillance systems are not robust and accurate enough to alert from the presence of birds in resstricted areas.

The main purpose of this IRP project is the development of a tracking solution for the surveillance of birds in airports to tackle the problem of birds monitoring. This tracking system aim to track and monitor birds in particular in restricted airports area in order to reduce the risks of bird strikes. The system developed during this project has beed designed to meet the following objectives:

- Track and monitor birds from a static camera position
- Follow the trajectory of any other moving objects
- Robustly handle challenging situations.

The tracking system proposed during this IRP aim to address the problem of birds monitoring in airports. The objective is to include the tracking algorithm as part of a surveillance system in order to alert from the presence of any moving objects, in particular birds. It would therefore increase the safety in airports.

This document describes the different components of this project and their usage.
